# Web-Playlist

This project is an example of a simple site built with HTML, CSS and a little bit of jQuery. An open-source project that gives you the oportunity to listen your favorite music from the existent sets of melodies in your browser and, if you want to expend the variety of playlists and songs, you can do it with no costs. Download the souce code from my GitHub Account and see where this idea could get.

# Note

The site is not 100% finished, because of some issues with the dimensions of video content.
